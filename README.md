#Musiz Quiz App
This is an web app that asks the user to identify the artist and album a set of lyrics are from. The user can also play the music for a clue to answer the question. This was done in Html, CSS, Bootstrap, Handlebars, Run-Auto, Request, Jquery, Javascript, Json, Node, Express, Spotify Api, MusixMatch Api, and spotify-web-api-node. You can see the website in action on https://spring-ninja.hyperdev.space and while it works for the most part, it is still a WIP.
